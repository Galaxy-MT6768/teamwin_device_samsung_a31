# Samsung Galaxy A31 [SM-A315G/F] [a31nsxx & a31xx] - Team Win Recovery Project
[Telegram Support Group](https://t.me/a31nsxx)
```diff
+ TWRP Status: Mostly Stable. 
- Releases tagged as "Pre-release" are considered experimental and may cause more unexpected stuff than the latest release, nobody is forced to support your in older releases.
```
Set the ``TW_CUSTOM_THEME``flag for a custom theme.

Build with twrp-11 to avoid the recovery.img being bigger than the partition.

Run ``chmod +x device/samsung/a31/mkbootimg`` to avoid building issues.
